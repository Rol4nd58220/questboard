I want you to use this as a reference to the active tab:


This section describes the behavior and UI for the "Active" tab in the JobSeeker's homepage. It displays the jobs where the employer has already accepted the applicant.

for the active tab:
- after the employer has accepted the applicant applying for the job it will go to the Active job
- in the active job I want you to still do the vertically scrollable card for the past completed job and the recently active jobs
- in the card for the recently active jobs I want a view button after clicking the view button an depth details it will have the phone number of the employer and email
- beside the view button I want a button saying message the employer while using the app and it will redirect you to the messages page with the employer account to message them
- I want the data stored and retrieved so that the employer could also see the messages also for the in depth details get it from the firestore database
- Message Employer Button Next to the "View" button, add a "Message Employer" button. Clicking it should: Redirect the user to the Messages page, automatically opening a chat with the employer (identified by their account ID). Messages between jobseeker and employer should be stored and retrieved via Firestore.
