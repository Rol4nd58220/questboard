I want you to use this as a guide on what to do:


for the pages jobs, messages and profile remove the search button, filter chips and categories and the filter button



for the job page I want you to add this:

* under the top bar I want it there to have Applied and Active having a line underneath it
* if its click or on that fragment for example the applied I want the it to be 100% opacity if it's 50% opacity goes both ways
* but I want it to start with applied so make it 100% opacity



for the messages:

* I want to have a search bar called Search Messages
* and have a button on top of the bottom\_nav a circle with a plus sign on it for adding messages



for the profile:

* leave it for now add just a log out button



also there seem to be a missing page called community



for the community page:

* add a search bar called search post so that it can search all of the post it want related to that search
* below the search bar I want a card saying share something with the community beside with a 50% opacity on the left on that I want to have the profile pic of the account if there is none for now add a placeholder profile next is on that card I want an option where it can add an image and beside that a post button
